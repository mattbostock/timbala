# Development philosophy

AthensDB aims to:

- prefer simplicity over complexity
- state assumptions explicitly
- use data to verify assumptions
- make operational visibility a first-class concern
- make usability a first-class concern
- document design decisions, including the 'why' behind changes
- make development as transparent as possible to encourage contributions
- keep user-supplied configuration to a minimum to ease operation
